# Senior Project
This is a full stack web application that allows a user to compare [ChangeGear](https://www.sunviewsoftware.com/products/service-manager) ticket information.
## Approach
We used React and Redux for the front end. Redux goes well with React in state management that allowed us
to fetch information and store it in a global state. For the back end, we used Express to handle the database communication, and the creation of a REST API. For the database, we opted in using [MongoDB atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
## Steps to run the program
1. Install [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone the directory to a local repository
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
4. Type npm install in the terminal and wait for the installation to finish
5. Navigate to the client folder
6. Type npm install in the terminal and wait for the installation to finish
7. Navigate back to the root directory
8. Type npm run dev in the terminal to run the project
**NOTE: You need to create a .env file on the root directory with a custom MongoDB Atlas login.**
## What did we learn?
We learned how to use MongoDB Atlas in conjunction with a full stack web application. We also learned how to 
create a REST API that is able to perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations, and connect everything with a React/Redux front end.
